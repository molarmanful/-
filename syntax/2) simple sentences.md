#Simple Sentences
All sentences are wrapped in brackets (`[]`).

Rules for forming a sentence:

- Every sentence has at most 3 words: a subject, a predicate (action), and (optionally) an object.
- <code>`</code> comes before a word acting as the subject of the sentence.
- `´` comes before a word acting as the object of the sentence.
- Subjects must come before objects.
- The word not marked as a subject or object is the predicate.

Example:

```
[`¹ ⇌¯ ´―]  I path-over land => I go over land.
[`¹ ´― ⇌¯]  (alternative ordering)
```
