#Simple Sentences
All sentences are wrapped in brackets (`[]`).

Rules for forming a sentence:

- Every sentence has at most 3 words: a subject, a predicate (action), and (optionally) an object.
- <code>`</code> comes before a word acting as the subject of the sentence.
- `´` comes before a word acting as the object of the sentence.
- Subjects must come before objects.
- The word not marked as a subject or object is the predicate.
- A sentence containing only the predicate (and optionally an object) is a command.

Example:

```
[`¹ ♥ ´!]  I-sub. FEEL GOOD-obj.

Alternative arrangements:
[`¹ ´! ♥]
[♥ `¹ ´!]
```
