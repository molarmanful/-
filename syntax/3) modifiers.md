#Modifiers
##`()`
Use parentheses to join several words into a list.

```
[`(¹ ²) ⇌ ´?£]  (I,you) path unknown-left => Should you and I go left?
```
##`{}`
Use curly brackets inside words to join roots inside a word.

```
[`¹ ⇌ ´?{/←→}]  I path unknown-{alternation-backward-forward} => Should I go backward or forward?
```
Notice that `{/←→}` describes `?`, and `←→` describe `/`.
