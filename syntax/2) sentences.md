#Sentences
All sentences are wrapped in brackets (`[]`).

Rules for forming a sentence:

- Every sentence has at most 4 words: a subject, a predicate (action), and (optionally) a direct/indirect object.
- <code>`</code> comes before a word acting as the subject of the sentence.
- `´` comes before a word acting as the direct object of the sentence.
- `˝` comes before a word acting as the indirect object of the sentence.
- Words in a sentence can be rearranged in any way as long as each word is properly marked. Try to keep a consistent part-of-speech pattern throughout long passages, though.
- The word not marked as a subject or object is the predicate.
- A sentence containing only the predicate (and optionally an object) is a command.
- A sentence containing only a subject and object means that the subject has the qualities of the object.

Example:

```
[`¹ ♥ ´!]  I-sub. FEEL GOOD-d_obj.

Some alternative arrangements:
[`¹ ´! ♥]
[♥ ´! `¹]
```
