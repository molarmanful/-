# Overview
`"` is an language based on Unicode symbols. Its fundamental elements are roots, which represent basic ideas.

# Features
**Oligosynthesis**: `"` has few roots, but these roots often join together to form larger words.

**Loose Grammar**: More on this later; basically, roots and words can be moved around rather freely.

**Absence of POS**: Conventional parts of speech are done away with. Instead, the roots change into actions with a few modifiers.
