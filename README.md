#`"`
Here lies the documentation for a linguistic experiment of mine, `"`. `"` is (at least for now) an only-written language that uses Unicode symbols in place of words. Probably not suitable for everyday communication, but still a rather interesting idea.

Start by looking at `/vocab/roots.md`, then reading `/syntax`. After, take a look at `/examples` for a better feel of the language.
